= Couchbase Columnar SDK Documentation

This repository hosts the common documentation source for the
https://docs.couchbase.com/home/columnar-sdk.html[Couchbase Columnar SDK Documentation].


This branch contains common documents and document fragments for the 1.0 API release of each columnar SDK.
It follows the https://docs.couchbase.com/columnar-java-sdk/1.0/project-docs/compatibility.html#api-version[columnar SDK 1.0 API].


== Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
Please test them locally, and then submit a pull request.
A guide to using asciidoc, building Antora locally, and working with our repos can be found at https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/index.html[https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/index.html] (this may still be in the middle of being updated).

At a minimum, to build the docs locally, you will need:

* This repo,
https://github.com/couchbase/docs-columnar-sdk-common[docs-columnar-sdk-common],
* One of the actual columnar SDK repos, such as
https://github.com/couchbase/docs-columnar-sdk-common[docs-columnar-sdk-common],
* And the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-server[Server Docs repo]

in your Antora playbook.

If you are not sure the best way to update the docs, please raise a JIRA ticket with your suggestion, putting in as much information as possible.
You can do this by clicking on the *Leave Feedback* button on any of the docs pages --
usually found near the top right of the page.

Alternatively, raise a
https://github.com/couchbase/docs-columnar-sdk-common/issues[GitHub issue] in this repository.

=== Directory Structure

Antora modules used for each SDK's repo are as follows:

* concept-docs -- discussion docs explaining SDK-relevant aspects of Couchbase & Columnar; in the published docs these are now interleaved with the howtos, rather than in a separate section.
This module also contains the mini landing pages which introduce each section.
* devguide/examples -- the home of all code examples.
* hello-world -- overview (landing page) and the introductory tutorials.
* howtos -- practical explanations, with plenty of code snippets.
These are the docs used by the majority of developers.
* project-docs -- deployment section.
Docs that you need to use the software (compatibility tables, release notes, etc.), but which are not about the software API.
* ref -- reference material, such as error codes and client settings.
* ROOT -- contains `nav.adoc`, the navigation file for this component.

Within each module, docs content is mostly found in the `pages` directories, as `.adoc` files.
Occasionally, a partial fragment in a `partials` directory contains content reused over more than one page.

Most re-use is from single-sourced content in from https://github.com/couchbase/docs-columnar-sdk-common[this sdk-common repo].
Here, the content is divided between partials and full pages, in the manner described below.


== Repository Structure

The files and directories in this repository are organized as an auxilary Antora documentation component.
That means this repository doesn't contribute any pages to the documentation directly.
Instead, it provides a) partial files (both complete pages and page fragments) which can be included into pages from another component and b) shared images that those pages can reference.

At a high level, this repository contains two modules, which serve two distinct purposes:

* pages
* shared

The *pages* module (not to be confused with Antora's pages folder), contains complete pages in the form of partials.
These partials are the common pages shared by all the Columnar SDKs.

The *shared* module contains page fragments, also in the form of partials.
These partials hold information common to all the Columnar SDKs, but which do not constitute complete pages.

=== Pages Module

The pages module has the following structure starting from the root of the repository:

....
modules/
  pages/
    partials/
      *.adoc
    assets/
      images
        *.png
....

Although the AsciiDoc files are located in the [.path]_partials_ folder, they are, in fact, complete pages.
The only reason they're located in the [.path]_partials_ folder is so that they don't get turned into pages directly.
Instead, they need to be included into pages in the language-specific Columnar SDKs.


////
==== Usage

One example is the "`Sample Application`" page, located in this repository at [.path]_modules/pages/partials/sample-application.adoc_.
To promote this common page to a concrete page in one of the language-specific SDKs, create the following file in that SDK and populate it with a single include directive, as follows:

.modules/ROOT/pages/sample-application.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::6.0@sdk:pages:partial$sample-application.adoc[]
----

The include directive effectively imports the common page into a page in the language-specific SDK documentation.
Every common page must have a corresponding master page in every language-specific SDK.
////


////
==== Page References

All page references in the common page are assumed to be relative to the module in which the page is included (i.e., relative to the master page).
Thus, the reference `+xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with SQL++]+` refers to the [.path]_n1ql-query.adoc_ page in the same module as [.path]_sample-application.adoc_ master page in the language-specific SDK.

References to all other locations, such as to server, must provide the necessary context (component, version, module, etc).

All the common pages include a shared attributes file, [.path]_modules/pages/partials/attributes.adoc_

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document Title
\include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

...
----

The attributes file controls the version of Couchbase Server (`version-server`) as well as the path to shared images (`incimagesdir`), which will get to in the next section.

The `version-server` attribute is used in the common pages to refer to pages in the Couchbase Server documentation.
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Use the xref:7.1@server:tools:query-workbench.adoc[Query Workbench] to issue queries using the web console.
----

Using the attributes file allows the server version to be managed in a single place.
////



==== Image References

Using images in the common folders is a little tricky because Antora doesn't yet support image references outside the current module (nor does the include cause the context to change).
Therefore, it's necessary to employ a workaround.

To workaround this limitation in Antora, the location of images in common pages is controlled using a shared attribute named `incimagesdir`.
Here's how you'll use it to specify the location of images in these common pages:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::{incimagesdir}/travel-app-narration.png[]
----

_This is the only time in Antora you would use an attribute reference at the start of an image target._

The `incimagesdir` attribute is defined in the attributes file, [.path]_modules/pages/partials/attributes.adoc_.
The value of this attribute refers to the relative path to the images folder in the pages module (though it has to do a bit of a reach to get there).

You don't have to worry about any of these details as long as you prefix the image target with `{incimagesdir}` for now.

=== Shared Module

The shared module has the following structure starting from the root of the repository:

....
modules/
  shared/
    partials/
      *.adoc
....

This module is a little easier to understandn because it contains partials which really are partials (i.e., page fragments).
These partials can be included into any page in the language-specific SDK documentation to provide shared content such as reference sections, explanations, definitions, phrases, etc.

Although not required, the content in these partials is often selected using a tag or tags.



////
==== Usage

One example is the introduction to views in the file [.path]_modules/ROOT/pages/view-queries-with-sdk.adoc_ for a language-specific SDK.

[source,asciidoc]
----
\include::6.0@sdk:shared:partial$views.adoc[tag=views-intro]
----

This imports a page fragment that looks like the following:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
// tag::views-intro[]
--
The normal CRUD methods allow you to look up a document by its ID.
...

TIP: See xref:7.1@server:understanding-couchbase:views/views-intro.adoc[Views].
--
// end::views-intro[]
-----

All the lines between `tag::views-intro[]` and `end::views-intro[]` get imported into the page.
////



==== Page References

Like the common pages, all page references in shared partials are assumed to be relative to the module in which the partial is included.
Thus, the reference `+xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with SQL++]+` refers to the [.path]_n1ql-query.adoc_ page in the same module as [.path]_sample-application.adoc_ in the language-specific SDK.

References to all other locations, such as to server, must provide the necessary context (component, version, module, etc).

Unlike the common pages, the partials do not import a shared attributes file.
That's because partials can be included partially and thus bypass attributes defined in the document header.
Unfortunately, that means that the references in the share partials to the server have to be hard-coded for now.

[source,asciidoc]
----
See xref:7.1@server:understanding-couchbase:views/views-intro.adoc[Views].
----

==== Image References

Currently, the shared module doesn't contain any images.
If they are added, a different workaround will have to be developed since not all partials would pick up a shared attributes file.

=== Single-sourced Content

To make maintenance easier for docs of around a dozen SDKs, content that is common across SDK docsets is -- wherever possible -- single-sourced from the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-columnar-sdk-common[sdk-common] repo.

We recognise that this adds a slight cognitive burden for the new maintainer, but one layer of abstraction seems a reasonable compromise for maintainability.
To make content re-use workable, certain replaceable attributes are used.
These are found in the antora.yml file.

.Attributes for Single-sourced Content
|===
| Attribute | Use

| `server_version:`
| SDK dotminor releases contain new APIs to match new Server releases.
This is the release version of Capella Columnar that this SDK release accompanied.
Not often needed within the SDK documentation -- the server version in `xref` links is set with  `version-server:` (see below).

| `sdk_current_version:` | Sets the current patch version.

| `sdk_dot_minor:` | The current dotminor.

| `sdk_dot_major:` | The current major release -- not often needed within the documentation.

| `version-server:` | This is substituted into `xref` links to the Server, to ensure they land on the correct release version.

| `version-common:`
| The version (branch) of the single-sourced `sdk-common` repo.
This is substituted into Antora `include::` directives, to pull in content from the correct branch.

| `name_platform:` | Allows us to name the SDK within shared content (*Scala*).

| `name-sdk:` | Allows us to name the SDK within shared content (*Scala SDK*).

| `sdk_api:` | The API version of this release.

| `sdk-api-link:` | Link to the latest API Reference for the SDK.

| `sdk-gh-link:` | Link to the source code of the SDK.

|===


An additional attribute, `page-nav-header-levels: 1`, ensures that the left-hand navigation of the site opens with each topic unfurled by one level.

=== Page Headers

Each `.adoc` page contains information in the headers:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Compatibility
:description: Platform compatibility, and features available in different SDK versions, and compatibility between Server and SDK. \
Plus notes on Cloud, networks, and AWS Lambda.
:page-aliases: ROOT:overview,ROOT:compatibility-versions-features,compatibility-versions-features
:page-toclevels: 3
:table-caption!:
----

The `:page-aliases:` directive enables Antora to build 502 redirects -- meaning that inbound links from, for example, old blog posts will still work with the current docset.

`:page-toclevels:` should be set to `2` to include h3 headers along with h2s in the in-page navigation (right-hand nav).
Leaving out this directive means that the page will default to `1`, showing only h2 headers in the in-page nav.
A value of `3` should not be used, save in exceptionally complicated pages like that shown (the https://docs.couchbase.com/scala-sdk/1.6/project-docs/compatibility.html[compatibility page]).

=== Patch Releases

Update the following files:

* antora.yml
* build.gradle
* modules/devguide/examples/scala/pom.xml
* modules/project-docs/pages/sdk-release-notes.adoc
////



=== New Branches

Production branches use the *release/x.y* naming pattern (e.g. `release/3.7`, `release/3.6`).
Antora uses the branch names in the playbook, but also uses the `version` given in the antor.yml file, to create the version navigation -- so this version number must be unique within the repo for any branches included in the playbook.
When creating a new branch for a new release, remember to update the antora.yml file before trying to build.

=== Code Sample Testing

This is in the process of being changed -- documentation will appear here once this is completed.
