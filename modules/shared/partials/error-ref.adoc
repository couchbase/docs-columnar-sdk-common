[abstract]
The standardized error codes returned by the Couchbase SDK, from cloud connection to sub-document.


// tag::intro[]
All exceptions derive from a common base Couchbase exception.
Exceptions (errors) are broken into different classifications:

* Shared Exceptions -- exceptions or errors thrown or returned by any service.
* Specific Exceptions -- exceptions or errors thrown by a service and specific to the service that threw or returned them.
* Internal Exceptions -- exceptions intended to be handled internally by the SDK and not exposed to the application.


The base exception, `CouchbaseException`, has two properties -- an `ErrorContext` and an optional _Cause_.
The `ErrorContext` provides extensive debugging information in JSON format.


Below are the exceptions, categorised by service.

== Shared Error Definitions
// tag::shared[]
ID Range: 1-99

=== # 1 Timeout

Raised when a request cannot be completed until the user-defined timeout fires.

Note, this is a base class for #13 and #14 (Ambiguous and Unambiguous).

=== # 2 RequestCanceled

Raised when a request is cancelled and cannot be resolved in a non-ambiguous way.
Most likely the request is in-flight on the socket and the socket gets closed.
