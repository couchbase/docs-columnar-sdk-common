{description}


The 1.0 SDK requires Java 17 or later to be installed.
We recommend using the most recent long-term support (LTS) version of OpenJDK.

TIP: Remember to keep your Java installation up to date with the latest patches.




== Platform Compatibility


=== JDK Version Compatibility

// tag::jdk-version[]
The {name-sdk} is tested with Oracle JDK and OpenJDK.
Other JDK implementations might work but are not tested and are unsupported.
We recommend running the latest LTS version (i.e. at the time of writing JDK 21) with the highest patch version available.

The following JDK releases are supported:

* https://adoptium.net/[OpenJDK 21 with HotSpot JVM] (recommended)
* https://adoptium.net/[OpenJDK 17 with HotSpot JVM]
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17[Oracle JDK 17]

Please make sure you run on one of the latest patch releases, since they provide stability improvements and security fixes in general.

=== OS Compatibility

// tag::os-compat-jvm[]
In general, the JVM eliminates concerns about underlying OS compatibility, 
and Couchbase JVM SDKs can be expected to run on all of the Operating Systems supported by xref:{version-server}@server:install:install-platforms.adoc[Couchbase Server].

The {name-sdk} is tested and supported on the following OSs and platforms:

****
[discrete]
=== GNU/Linux

* Amazon Linux 2 & AL2023.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 & 9;
* Oracle Linux 8 & 9.
* Ubuntu (LTS) 20.04 (_Focal_) & 22.04 (_Jammy_).
* Debian 10 (_Buster_), 11 (_Bullseye_), and Debian 12 (_Bookworm_).
* SUSE Enterprise Linux 12 & 15
// * Alpine Linux 3.18 (_Oracle JDK only_) -- but see <<alpine-linux-compatibility, workaround note below>>.

[discrete]
=== Microsoft Windows

* Microsoft Windows 10 & 11;
* Windows Server 2019 & 2022.

[discrete]
=== Mac OS X

The current and previous two releases of OS X.
At time of writing (October 2024): 14 (Sonoma), 13 (Ventura), and 12 (Monterey).
M1 ARM  architecture is fully supported in the {name-sdk}.

[discrete]
=== ARM Processor Support

AWS Amazon Graviton, Apple M1 ARM processors, and ARMv8 on Ubuntu 20.04+.
****

The JVM ColumnarSDKs should also be expected to run on other commonly-available GNU/Linux distributions which support an appropriate JDK, but not all combinations can be tested -- notable exceptions are listed below.
// end::os-compat-jvm[]






==== Alpine Linux Compatibility

The https://netty.io[Netty] I/O library used by our JVM SDKs supports native optimizations to achieve higher throughput and lower latency 
-- which the SDK enables by default. 
Those modules are compiled against `glibc` and Alpine Linux uses `musl` instead --
so the {name-sdk} is unable to complete bootstrapping on this platform.

Because Alpine Linux does not have the `glibc` support needed,
we highly recommend that you seek an alternative distribution where possible. 
If that is not a option, then a possible workaround that can be applied is as follows:

* Disable native IO and native TLS by setting both the `ioEnvironment.enableNativeIo` and `security.enableNativeTls` client settings to false, as in this example:
+
[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect(
  connectionString,
  ClusterOptions.clusterOptions(username, password)
    .environment(env -> env
      .ioEnvironment(it -> it.enableNativeIo(false))
      .securityConfig(it -> it.enableNativeTls(false))
    )
);
----

* Alternatively, disable it in Netty itself via the following system properties:
+
[source,shell]
----
-Dcom.couchbase.client.core.deps.io.netty.transport.noNative=true
-Dcom.couchbase.client.core.deps.io.netty.handler.ssl.noOpenSsl=true
----

The downside of these workarounds is potentially reduced performance, which can be determined through benchmarking and profiling.
