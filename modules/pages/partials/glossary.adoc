:description: Unpicking the tangled alphabet soup of the Capella Columnar Platform, from an SDK perspective.


[abstract]
{description}



Capella Columnar SDK documentation uses terms from Columnar which may carry different meanings from those same terms in other parts of Couchbase.
Below you will find short definitions of many Columnar-related terms, with links to the pages that describe them in more detail, or show practical examples of their use.
In particular, we look to define terms that may -- of necessity -- carry slight variations of meaning from their Capella operational cluster use.
