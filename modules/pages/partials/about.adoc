Welcome to the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#api-version[{name-sdk} {sdk_dot_minor}] docs -- 
this is an _afterword_ to the documentation, rather than something most people will read as a _foreword_.
Why so?
On most occasions you will arrive at a page directly from a search engine or LLM, perhaps follow a link to another page or two, and then depart (with, we hope, your questions answererd).
This page is to help with those occasions when you are unsure precisely what you want, but you are after understanding --
so this page is a guide to the SDK docs, to help you to get the most from them.


== Assumptions & Presumptions

Couchbase is a complex and powerful product, with many components.
The Columnar SDKs simply interact with Capella Columnar, not Couchbase Server and its various services --
but some of that complexity spills across into the Columnar SDKs and their documentation.

Some concepts, such as Role-Based Access Control, do need to be understood in greater depth -- 
but this is documented xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[in the appropriate place in the Server docs], and the xref:cloud:projects:project-roles.adoc[Capella docs], 
and linked from the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started Guide].
Additionally, things which are essential in production can be a barrier to getting up and running quickly in order to try something out 
-- so the _Full Admin_ RBAC role is used in the _Hello World_ code example, contrary to best practice 
(but this is, of course, called out).

=== Concepts, Howtos, and Reference Information

Earlier Server SDK docs led with sections of Howto guides, with reference and discussion (concept) docs appended to the end along with project docs such as release notes.
Whilst howtos, with their easily parseable code snippets, are what the majority of developers want most of the time, 
a broader context is often needed go ensure that any SDK API is used appropriately.

Furthermore, for developers with less experience of databases in the distributed world, 
some discussion of the issues of consistency and isolation can ensure that the right decisions are made once your app use starts to scale up.
Hence each section carries a broad introduction, highlighting points to consider, but skippable by those who already know the territory.

=== Limits of the SDK Docs

Large as this docset is, it can only cover a subset of the complete Columnar SDK API.
For a comprehensive answer to anything not completely covered in these docs, your first port of call should always be the {sdk-api-link}[API reference].
For many languages, you will also access this from your chosen IDE.


== Getting Started

* xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Hello World]

The Getting Started section contains tutorial pages -- in intention, if not always in style -- 
covering xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[how to install and start using] the SDK.

It also contains information on connecting to the database, and a section of troubleshooting information for when the application code is remote from the database -- 
such as developing an app on your laptop, with the Cluster in the Cloud Service Provider's Zone some distance away -- 
a set-up not supported in production, but typical in development or evaluation.

////
== Data Modelling, Durability, and Consistency

* xref:concept-docs:data-durability-acid-transactions.adoc[Data Modelling, Durability, and Consistency]

A database has a simple job -- storing your data, and giving some of it back to you when you ask.
Behind that simplicity is a whole world of difficulty, to ensure the best combination of consistency and availability of documents partitioned across many nodes.
Our introduction suggests key areas to consider when scaling up your app.

This section also contains details of interacting with our super fast xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Data Service], 
bandwidth-saving xref:howtos:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document APIs], 
and xref:concept-docs:compression.adoc[compression], 
xref:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc[Field-Level Encryption], 
and xref:concept-docs:nonjson.adoc[working with non-JSON data].
////

== Querying Your Data

* xref:concept-docs:querying-your-data.adoc[]

The heart of the Columnar Service -- real-time OLAP querying, with Couchbase's familiar {sqlpp} query language.

////
For developers with an RDBMS, Couchbase's SQL implementation, {sqlpp}, makes querying familiar.
But don't be so quick to jump straight to {sqlpp} -- assess your use case carefully.

In addition to xref:howtos:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[{sqlpp} queries], 
and longer running xref:howtos:analytics-using-sdk.adoc[analytics queries] (OLAP) queries, 
and a xref:howtos:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Search Service]
(which includes xref:howtos:vector-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Vector Search]), 
you can quickly access data where you know keys or xref:howtos:kv-range-scan.adoc[key ranges], 
and this can be substantially quicker, thanks to the Data Service's speedy binary protocol.
////

////
== Dealing with Delays, Outages, and Unreliable Networks

* xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc[]

A distributed world brings challenges not just of node and network failures, but even of operating with uncertain knowledge of those things.
Couchbase is architected to give reliable results but as always, taking time to understand the issue can give you a more reliable application, and a better service to your users.

This section also contains details of the xref:concept-docs:response-time-observability.adoc[observability] stack available within the SDK, 
to help to identify problems and profile bottlenecks.
////



////
== Best Practices

* xref:concept-docs:best-practices.adoc[]

Choice is the mantra of many programming languages, and Couchbase offers support for many approaches to programming and architectural choices.
Where possible, we offer strong recommendations, for what will work best in _most_ circumstances.

This section also contains discussions for some of the xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc[best ways of dealing with errors and exceptions].
////


////
== Managing Couchbase

* xref:concept-docs:management-api.adoc[Managing Couchbase]

Some will prefer to administer Couchbase programmatically, rather than through UI, REST API, or command line.
This section covers the available management APIs in the SDK.
////

== SDK Deployment

* xref:project-docs:deployment.adoc[SDK Deployment]

A section on those non-programmatic considerations -- 
xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc[compatibility guides], 
// xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[migration], 
// xref:project-docs:third-party-integrations.adoc[third party integrations], 
xref:project-docs:sdk-licenses.adoc[licensing],
 and xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes].


== Reference Docs

* xref:ref:index.adoc[]

The key reference doc is the API guide, which should be an accurate and complete source of truth for programming with the {name_platform} SDK's API.
Any error here should be filed directly against the individual SDKs bug tracker -- via the GitHub issues on {sdk-gh-link} --
 although a ticket against the docs https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/DOC/issues[here] will always be converted to the correct project.

The first link in the navigation for the Reference Section is to the API Guide for the _latest version_ of the SDK.
Links to previous versions can be found with the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes].

Other reference material includes the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc[Client Settings] that can be adjusted, 
and a listing of all xref:ref:error-codes.adoc[Error Codes].


== Another Route Through?

Each page contains several links to related pages in the docs, as well as to relevant sections of the latest generated API docs.
Links are made to cover as many common user journeys as we could think of.
For cases where we didn't anticipate your needs, every page in each SDK is linked from the left-hand navigation, and the paragraphs above detail the broad purpose of these groupings and some of their content.

////
NOTE: Several _non-pages_ exist, in the sense that where a page found in one or more SDKs, such as the _Travel Sample Application_, is not available in one (or more) SDKs --
as, for example, we have not made a xref:3.0@c-sdk:hello-world:sample-application.adoc[libcouchbase Travel Sample Application] --
then a page will still exist, so that when navigating between SDKs through either the dropdown nav, or changing ghe name in the URL bar, you will not find yourself facing a 404 error, and will still have access to the left-hand nvigation for that SDK.
////

=== Site Search

Our internal _Site Search_ is an excellent resource for finding information across Couchbase components and (supported) versions.

////
== Older SDK Versions

All supported versions of the SDKs can be found in the doc set -- use the dropdown version selector in the left-hand navigation to reach each one.
Documentation on older, unsupported versions of the SDK -- that have reached end-of-life -- can be found in the https://docs-archive.couchbase.com/home/index.html[archive].
